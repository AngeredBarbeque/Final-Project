Login ---
If you want to play the game, you will have to create an account. To do this, select 'User' in the main menu and then select 'Create Account'.
If you've already made an account, select 'Log in' instead.

Scores ---
Since this game is a speedrunner, every level has its own timer and leaderboard system. The top 10 overall scores will be saved, along with each player's best score for every level.
Scores are sorted based on solely time; coins are an optional collectible.

Keys ---
To move, use WASD, space, or the arrow keys while in a level.
Press Esc at any time to pause the game.

Gameplay ---              
Levers, marked with '/', open doors, marked with '|'.
Coins, an optional collectible, are marked with 'C'.
Falling blocks, marked with 'â–“', disappear after you stand on them.
Spikes are represented with v, ^, <, >, and *. Spikes kill you on contact.
Reach the finish (marked with 'F') to save your score.
